<p>Before configuring Akka HTTP it must be added to your project as described in <a href="introduction.html#using-akka-http">the introduction</a>.</p>
<p>Just like any other Akka module Akka HTTP is configured via <a href="https://github.com/lightbend/config">Typesafe Config</a>. Usually this means that you provide an <code>application.conf</code> which contains all the application-specific settings that differ from the default ones provided by the reference configuration files from the individual Akka modules.</p>
<p>These are the relevant default configuration values for the Akka HTTP modules.</p>

    # The minimum duration to backoff new connection attempts after the previous connection attempt failed.
    #
    # The pool uses an exponential randomized backoff scheme. After the first failure, the next attempt will only be
    # tried after a random duration between the base connection backoff and twice the base connection backoff. If that
    # attempt fails as well, the next attempt will be delayed by twice that amount. The total delay is capped using the
    # `max-connection-backoff` setting.
    #
    # The backoff applies for the complete pool. I.e. after one failed connection attempt, further connection attempts
    # to that host will backoff for all connections of the pool. After the service recovered, connections will come out
    # of backoff one by one due to the random extra backoff time. This is to avoid overloading just recently recovered
    # services with new connections (&quot;thundering herd&quot;).
    #
    # Example: base-connection-backoff = 100ms, max-connection-backoff = 10 seconds
    #   - After 1st failure, backoff somewhere between 100ms and 200ms
    #   - After 2nd, between  200ms and  400ms
    #   - After 3rd, between  200ms and  400ms
    #   - After 4th, between  400ms and  800ms
    #   - After 5th, between  800ms and 1600ms
    #   - After 6th, between 1600ms and 3200ms
    #   - After 7th, between 3200ms and 6400ms
    #   - After 8th, between 5000ms and 10 seconds (max capped by max-connection-backoff, min by half of that)
    #   - After 9th, etc., stays between 5000ms and 10 seconds

    # This setting only applies to the new pool implementation and is ignored for the legacy one.
